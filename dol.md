# DOL meaning representation language
## Tree view of semantics
### Node types in DOL trees
  - **Constants**: Refer to specific objects in the world. A constant can be a number, a lexical string, or an entity.
  - **Classes**: Refer to a category of entities sharing common semantic properties. For example: `location.city`, `math.number`
    - Sub-class: *math.number âŠ† math.expression*
    - Template classes: classes with one or more parameters, for example: `t.list<c, m, n>`, where `c` is a class, `m` and `n` are integers.
  - **Functions**: The major way to form larger language units from smaller ones. A function is comprised of a *name*, a list of *core arguments*, and a *return type*.
    - Noun functions
      - Map entities to their properties or to other entities having specific relations withe the argument(s).
      - Are used to represent noun phrases in natural language.
      - Pronoun functions are special zero-argument noun functions.
    - Verb functions
      - Act as sentences or sub-sentences in DOL
      - The most important function type?
    - Modifier functions
      - Many functions can take additional *extended arguments* as their modifiers.
      - Modifier functions often take the role of extended arguments to modify noun function, verb functions or other modifier functions.
      - Are used in DOL as the semantic representation of adjectives, adverb phrases (including conjunctive adverb phrases), and prepositional phrases in NL
### Features of DOL
  - Strong typed
    - Type-compatibility: The type of each child of a function node should match the corresponding argument type of the function.
    - Open-domain type system.
    - Useful built-in data structures like `t.list` and `nf.list`
